# Autocorrect-Program-

The autocorrect program uses C++ to evaluate a sentence entered by user and identify the following errors:
1. First letter of the sentence should be an uppercase.
2. Reduce multiple spaces into a single space.
3. If not present, add a full stop at the end of the sentence.
4. If not present, add space after full stop or comma.
5. Change the very next letter after full stop to uppercase.
6. Change all the uppercase letters in the middle of a word to lowercase.
7. Indicate if there is any unopened or unclosed bracket.
